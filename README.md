# Electricity Bill Calculator

## Description
This program calculates and displays electricity bills based on predefined slab rates. The user can choose to display bills for slab 1, slab 2, or slab 3. The program uses a matrix to store electricity consumption data.

## Source Data
The source data is stored in a two-dimensional array called `electricity_matrix`. It contains the consumption costs for different slabs.

## Instructions
1. Write functions to calculate and display costs for slab 1, slab 2, and slab 3.
2. Function names for consistency:
    - `costSlab1()`: Calculate and display cost for slab 1.
    - `costSlab2()`: Calculate and display cost for slab 2.
    - `costSlab3()`: Calculate and display cost for slab 3.
The main part of the program is a loop that displays a menu and takes user input. It checks the user's choice and calls the corresponding functions to display the bills for the selected slabs. If the user enters any other key, the program terminates.
